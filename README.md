Asterisks indicate on-call 24-hour shifts with the rest being regular 24-hour shifts

In addition, it can also extract shifts from this kind of table

The program tries to find the month and year from the file name if given as "... MONTH YEAR.docx"
Unfortunately, it works only in Greek and only for .docx files
