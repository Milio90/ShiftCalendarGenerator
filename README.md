The program takes a shift table in the form shown in the image below and creates an .ics file for the requested employee

Asterisks indicate on-call 24-hour shifts with the rest being regular 24-hour shifts
The program tries to find the month and year from the file name if given as "... MONTH YEAR.docx"
Unfortunately, it works only in Greek and only for .docx files
